# week-report
weekely report
introduction
    According to the different works and other activities which we were done
    l understood what problems can be solved by  using machine learning and 
    how i can using algorithms of machine learning to solve it well.

    The concept of machine learning is very wide and it can be used to solve complex problems as well as simple one

    For this week l was passed through chapter one to chapter four and somehow in chapter.
    This help me to partsipate well in weekely assiment because l was understood.

    In chapter one l was learned and understood about what is ML, tools ML using to analysing dataset like numpy pandas              scipy,difference problems ML can solve models and algorithms of machine learning, types of machine learning,
    and appliction of machine learning

    Chapter 2 came with explainations of types of the machine learning but it was based more on supervised learning
      Through this chapter i was got to understood how to choose model  accoding to my dataset. It explain the complex model           and easy model, the importance and impact of choose complex model as well as choose easy model.
     through this chapter I was understood mchine learning models now l make more practises in order to understanding more            and more

     in chapter four i was learning feturing engineering and how to change categorical data to numerical data and vise versa
     also through this chapter now i can make data analysis well and make my data to be inform that model  can understanding          with work with it
challenges that i was facing during my studies
  The big challenge l was facing is to know whic things is important to understand for this time then other i will understand later. because there many things compare to the time.
  other challenges are
  >To meeting with new things that need more time to understand especially in chapter four
  >To know to apply macine learning to solving problems in real life 
  >analysis of data 
  >insuficient of materials for study but now i have it 
  >To get connected into gitlab in order to see infor and groups mambers
