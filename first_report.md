### AI IPT2018: week one report correction
- Introduction.

According to the different works and other activities which we were done.
l understood the concept of machine learning and  problems can be solved by  using machine learning and 
how i can using algorithms of machine learning to solve it well.

The concept of machine learning is very wide and it can be used to solve complex problems as well as simple one.
    Machine learning is the all about science of programming computer to understand data and use it to solve a problem
    
For week one, l was passed through chapter one to chapter four.
    This help me to partsipate well in weekely assiment because l was understood concept of machine learning.
 
 ML has following types
 - *Supervised ML*. 
this is about Learn a model from a given set of input-output pairs, in order to
predict the output of new inputs.
 
 - *Unsupervised ML*. 
this is all about Discover patterns and learn the structure of unlabelled data.
       
 - *ReiForcement ML*. 
learn what action to take on a give situation.
       
 Then l walked through  tools  using to analysing and visualized dataset like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and  scipy.
   
 Afte that l turned look about problems ML can solve using models and algorithms.ML can solve problem like,
 - Manual data entry
 - Detecting spam
 - product recommendetion
 - Financial analysis
 - Predictive maintenance
 - Image recognition

Through this week l was make sure l can make data analysis well and make my data to be inform that model  can understanding          with work with it.
