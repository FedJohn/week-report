**ParrotAilPT-2018 week 2 progress report**


    ParrotAiLPT-2018 week two progress report consign about **Deep learning**. Through this week l learned a lot of concepts and               had  more  practices for more understanding deep learning.
           Deep learning is the subpart of machine learning that discovers and extracts the useful features from data using model. Then l make a comparison between machine learning which l learning last week and deep learning, From there l get a concept that, deep learning can  be best by working with it but more complex in design a model.

    In machine learning we were deal with model to perform diferent operation but in deep learning we dealing with neural networks. Through deep learning l learned about the following neural networks:
       • Multilayer perceptron 
       • Convolution neural networks 
       • Recurrent neural networks

    In order to get clear results using you neural network, you have to pass some stages like:- 
       • loading your datasets from file 
       • make iteratable data loader 
       • Visualize your train dataset 
       • Define your model 
    Define loss function and optimizer 
      • Train network 
      • Visualize train loss 
      • Test network on the data test 
      • Visualize results

      I understood that deep learning have many applications in the world like 
    • Self driving car
    • Games 
    • Automatic colorization
    • Cyber attack prediction, etc

     Challenges that can face when dealing with deep learning are like availability of suitable datasets and to you can get datasets but  not enough, Also the ability of computer on analyzing data and training model.
